## Installation Guide

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can verify their installation by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal. If not installed, download them from the official Node.js website: [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en)

### Steps:

### 1. Clone the Project:

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to install the project. Then, use the `git clone` command to clone this project from GitHub. 
```
git clone https://github.com/sharmashekhar0/Thence_Assignment.git
```
### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

Once the cloning is complete, change directories into the newly created project folder:
```
cd Thence_Assignment
```
### 3. Install Dependencies:

Run the following command in your terminal to install the project's dependencies, which are listed in the package.json file:
```
npm install
```
This command will download and install all the necessary libraries and packages required for the project to function.

### 4. Start the Development Server:

Many React projects use a development server that allows you to make changes to your code and see them reflected in the browser without manually restarting the server. 
```
npm run dev
```
This will typically start the development server on a default port (usually localhost:3000). You can then open your web browser and navigate to that URL to view the running React application.
